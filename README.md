A fizz buzz code problem that mostly asked in interview question 


ðŸ“Œ if n founds to the multiple of 3 then,
         it will print "Fizz"
         
ðŸ“Œ if n founds to be the multiple of 5 then,
         it will print "Buzz"
         
ðŸ“Œ and if n founds to be multiple of both 3 and 5 then,
         it will print "FizzBuzz"
